Integration Test 
We used RestTemplate and HttpHeaders, and HttpEntity to execute the integration tests.
They allow us to simulate 

We prefer to opt for the TestNG framework, since it provides us with important features 
such as ordering tests, adding dependencies to tests (i.e. one test is only executed if the setup test passes) and grouping tests.
TestNG also has the advantage of running tests in parallel at the same time.

Please install TestNG plugin for Eclipse to run the tests: Help > Install New Software > Add http://beust.com/eclipse/ > Download TestNG Plugin 
 
RestTemplate is the Spring REST client. It is used for simultaneous client-side HTTP access. It simplifies the
interaction with HTTP servers and enforces RESTful systems. 
It executes the HTTP method for the given URI and returns an ResponseEntity object and can interact using any HTTP method.
HTTP headers are the name or value pairs that are displayed in the request and response messages.
Finally, HttpEntity<T> is a helper object which encapsulates header and body of an
HTTP request or response. 
We get full access to HTTP response, therefore we can look at the status code to make sure the operation was successful or look at the body of the whole response.
